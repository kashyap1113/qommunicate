Qommunicate
===========

Qommunicate is an IP messenger ( http://www.ipmsg.org ) clone which is cross platform and features
a more modern and intuitive user interface.

* Installation
==============

1) From source on UNIX systems
   Install the Qt development package ( http://www.trolltech.com ) for your respective platform.
   Then download the Qommunicate source package and extract it to a suitable location. Execute the following commands:

    $ cd /path/to/qommunicate
    $ cd src
    $ qmake
    $ make
    $ su -c 'make install'
    $ ./qommunicate

   If the build fails at any step, please send any of the AUTHORS an email. Qommunicate is not yet widely tested,
   but should work without a hitch on most systems.

2) From source on Windows
   Install the Qt Open Source version ( http://www.trolltech.com ). Then run the Qt development console.
   This will start a command prompt setup for compilation. Now perform the exact steps in (1) except for the
   make install part.
